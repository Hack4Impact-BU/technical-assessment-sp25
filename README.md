## Application Questions

### How the project went

The project went quite well, I was able to implement most of the bonus features along with the required ones. This was also a learning experience for me as it was the first project I built entirely with TypeScript and React-Query. I thought it was a challenging but rewarding experience as it required some critical thinking - especially when it came to the voting feature, fetching random songs, and displaying the top contributor badge - rather than mindlessly making API requests and displaying the response.

### What I would change about the next assessment

I think this project was well scoped and the requirements were well outlined without being too restrictive. I wouldn't change anything about the next assessment.
