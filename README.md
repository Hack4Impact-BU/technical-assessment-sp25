### How the project went

I thought the project went well, even though this was my first time using Typescript and Next.js. The entire process was pretty challeging because I had to learn it all as I went, but I'm glad I did it and it helped me build a stronger all-around understanding of web dev. I wish I used React-query for loading states and management because it would have been easier to deal with a few problems I encountered. I'm glad I was able to deploy my project on Vercel, despite the numerous networking and environment variable issues that came up. I didn't get to implement the voting feature, but I did a lot more than I expected. There were some features and visual components I would love to have added if I had more time, but learning as you go makes projects much more time consuming, so I didn't get to it.

### What I would change about the next assessment

I thought this project was fun and I had a reasonable amount of time to work on it; next time I would love to see some different features like the top contributor one. Overall it was a good assessment of full stack dev skills.

Thank you Khoa for having this readme I could template from
