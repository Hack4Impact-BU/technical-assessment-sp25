I found the frontend aspect of the project a little more difficult than the backend
because I'm not super familiar with using React. I also liked using a UI library
so that it was relatively cohesive, and if I could do it again I would choose a different
one. There are some bugs, but I'm happy with what I'm submitting for the 
timeframe I spent on it! I would also spend more time on the aesthetics if I had it.

I'm not sure if the what I would change about the assessment refers to what I would change
about my work or just the assessment in general. I answered what I would do differently above
and in my video though, and I don't think there's anything I'd change about the assessment.
I thought it was rewarding, regardless of if I get a position or not.
