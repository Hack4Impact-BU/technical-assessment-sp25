## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
Hi! Here's my finished technical assessment for the JDT team. As requested, I have provided a version of my web app that is runnable (has no database) in the noDatabase folder. However, my finalised web app is in withDatabaseAndHistory. The finalised version has a mongoDB database, and persistend comment storage and the ability to view songs and comments from previous days, as my video will show.
